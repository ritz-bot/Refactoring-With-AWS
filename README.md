# Refactoring with AWS

Welcome to the **Refactoring with AWS** project! This repository demonstrates how to re-architect an existing application stack by leveraging AWS-managed services to improve agility, scalability, and performance while reducing operational overhead.

---

## 📝 Problem Statement

Managing application workloads with traditional infrastructure can be operationally expensive and time-consuming. Here are the key challenges:

- **High operational overhead**: Managing multiple services like databases, web servers, and DNS requires specialized teams.
- **Manual processes**: Scaling, monitoring, and maintenance are time-intensive.
- **High costs**: Infrastructure management incurs significant upfront capital and operational expenditures.
- **Lack of automation**: Processes are often not optimized for agility and innovation.

---

## 💼 Business Case

Transitioning to **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** and **Software as a Service (SaaS)** offerings from AWS allows for:

- **Increased agility**: Adding new features and scaling is faster and more efficient.
- **Reduced costs**: The pay-as-you-go model minimizes expenses.
- **Improved performance**: AWS-managed services ensure optimal application workload performance.
- **Automation-friendly infrastructure**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) enables automated deployments and management.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To refactor a legacy web application stack using AWS services, implementing:

- **Flexible and scalable infrastructure**.
- **PaaS and SaaS services for better manageability**.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** to automate deployments.

## 🛠️ AWS Services Used

### Frontend
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Hosts the application with built-in auto-scaling and load balancing.
- **Amazon S3**: Stores application artifacts.
- **Amazon CloudFront**: Acts as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for a global audience.

### Backend
- **Amazon RDS**: Managed database service with automated backups and scaling.
- **Amazon ElastiCache**: Provides in-memory data caching.
- **Amazon MQ**: Messaging service to replace RabbitMQ.
- **Amazon Route 53**: Domain Name System (DNS) service.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

1. **User Access**:
   - User requests are routed via **Amazon Route 53** DNS to a **CloudFront** CDN endpoint.
2. **Frontend**:
   - **Elastic Load Balancer** (ELB) within **Elastic Beanstalk** forwards requests to auto-scaled EC2 instances running the application.
3. **Backend**:
   - Application communicates with **RDS**, **ElastiCache**, and **Amazon MQ** for database, caching, and messaging services.
4. **Monitoring**:
   - **Amazon CloudWatch** tracks performance and scales resources as needed.

---

## 🔄 Flow of Execution

1. **Login to AWS Console**:
   - Create a key pair for Elastic Beanstalk-managed EC2 instances.
   - Define security groups for backend services (RDS, ElastiCache, MQ).

2. **Backend Setup**:
   - Deploy services: RDS, ElastiCache, and Amazon MQ.
   - Update security group rules to allow traffic between Beanstalk and backend services.

3. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Create an Elastic Beanstalk environment.
   - Configure health checks, HTTPS listeners, and deploy application artifacts.

4. **Database Initialization**:
   - Launch an EC2 instance, connect to RDS, and initialize the database schema.

5. **Content Delivery Network**:
   - Set up **CloudFront** with an SSL certificate for secure HTTPS connections.

6. **DNS Configuration**:
   - Integrate Route 53 or external DNS (e.g., GoDaddy) with the application endpoint.

7. **Testing**:
   - Validate functionality via the application's public URL.

## 📋 Key Benefits of Refactoring

- **Simplified management** with AWS-managed services.
- **Seamless scalability** for growing workloads.
- **Cost optimization** using PaaS/SaaS and a pay-as-you-go model.
- **Improved user experience** with global content delivery and automated scaling.
